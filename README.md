Learning Repo

⚬ This repo is part of my tech learning journey. Some files here may feel rough or experimental...it's intentional. I believe in showing the process, not just the polished result.

About Me

⚬ Entry-level technologist exploring IT support, software, and cybersecurity basics

⚬ Curious and trainable → open to any entry-level tech role

⚬ Building a foundation in Python, Java, HTML/CSS, networking, and troubleshooting

Why It Looks Messy

⚬ This repo captures experiments, drafts, and practice exercises. It’s not about perfect code...it’s about documenting growth.
